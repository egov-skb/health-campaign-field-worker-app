üì¶ Health Campaign Management V1.6 - Field Worker's App
====================================================



‚ú® Overview
--------

The Health Campaign Management (HCM) [latest version](https://github.com/egovernments/health-campaign-field-worker-app/tags) field worker's app is part of the DIGIT Health Platform. It empowers frontline teams to manage health campaigns efficiently, even in low or no network coverage areas. With its offline-first functionality and configurable design, the app is built to address the unique needs of field workers, ensuring seamless data collection, beneficiary management, and campaign tracking.

--------

‚ú® Key Features
------------

-   **Offline Mode**: Perform all tasks without active internet connectivity.

-   **Four New Modules**: Enable efficient task execution for frontline workers.

-   **Configurable Design**: Adaptable to various campaign needs through server-based configurations.

-   **Multi-Round Campaign Support**: Manage multiple campaign cycles with eligibility checks, delivery tracking, and side-effect recording.

-   **Sync Mechanism**: Bidirectional sync (up and down) ensures consistent data between the app and server.

-   **Beneficiary Data Management**: Optimized retrieval and duplication prevention for beneficiary records.

-   **Permission-Based Access**: Data sync tailored to user roles and assigned projects.

--------

‚ú® Architecture
------------

The high-level architecture of the app is divided into three core parts:

1.  **Frontend**: Built using Flutter for a multi-platform, user-friendly experience.

2.  **Backend Services**: Syncs with MDMS, localisation, and other backend services.

3.  **Database**: Combines SQLite and ISAR for flexible offline data storage.



‚ú® Tech Stack/Core Dependencies
----------------------------

-   **Flutter**: Framework to build multi-platform apps.

-   **SQLite**: SQL offline database for structured data.

-   **ISAR**: NoSQL offline database for high-performance storage.

-   **Dio**: HTTP client for network communication.



‚ú® Design Considerations
---------------------



###  ‚úÖ General Considerations

-   Works seamlessly in low/no network coverage areas.

-   Highly configurable, with settings managed through MDMS.

-   Designed for Android devices, ensuring compatibility with users who have low-tech literacy.



###  ‚úÖ Sync Mechanism

-   **Sync Down**: Fetch configurations and data from the server (e.g., localisation, master data).

-   **Sync Up**: Upload collected data to the server.

-   **Login & Sync**: Syncing can only occur while the user is online.



###  ‚úÖ Configurability

Key configurations include:

-   Offline-first or online-only mode.

-   Backend service URLs and endpoints (no app rebuild required for updates).

-   Data refresh intervals for previously fetched configurations.

-   Supported languages and localisation data.



###  ‚úÖ Operational Log (Op Log)

All offline actions are logged and processed during sync-up to ensure data consistency and integrity.



###  ‚úÖ Network Manager

A network manager component abstracts the online/offline logic, enabling seamless data handling by other app components.



‚ú® Modules and Features
--------------------



###  ‚úÖ Down Sync of Beneficiaries

Ensures the local device database is updated with the latest beneficiary data while preventing duplicate records.

**Key Features:**

-   Uses offset and limit for efficient pagination.

-   Adapts batch size based on internet speed.

-   Essential for reducing redundancy within the same boundary.

**Use Case:**

-   Particularly useful in multi-user scenarios where teams operate in the same geographical boundary.



###  ‚úÖ Multi-Round Campaigns

Supports tracking and delivery processes across multiple cycles.

**Key Features:**

-   Fetches configurations dynamically from MDMS.

-   Checks eligibility criteria based on age and project configurations.

-   Tracks delivery status, side effects, and referrals.

-   Resets statuses (e.g., Beneficiary Refused) for each new cycle.

**Delivery Status Tracking:**

-   **Not Eligible**: Fails age or cycle eligibility criteria.

-   **Beneficiary Refused**: User declined the delivery.

-   **Beneficiary Referred**: Referred to a health facility.

-   **Visited**: Delivery successfully completed.

-   **Not Visited**: Delivery not completed.

### **‚ú® Downsyncing Data During Boundary Selection**

If you need to **downsync registration-delivery data** during boundary selection, modify **project_beneficiaries_downsync.dart** by including the following repositories:

```
final LocalRepository<HouseholdModel, HouseholdSearchModel> householdLocalRepository;
final LocalRepository<HouseholdMemberModel, HouseholdMemberSearchModel> householdMemberLocalRepository;
final LocalRepository<ProjectBeneficiaryModel, ProjectBeneficiarySearchModel> projectBeneficiaryLocalRepository;
final LocalRepository<TaskModel, TaskSearchModel> taskLocalRepository;
final LocalRepository<SideEffectModel, SideEffectSearchModel> sideEffectLocalRepository;
final LocalRepository<ReferralModel, ReferralSearchModel> referralLocalRepository;
```

Next, locate the method:

```
networkManager.writeToEntityDb
```

Ensure it includes the repositories:

```
householdLocalRepository,
householdMemberLocalRepository,
projectBeneficiaryLocalRepository,
taskLocalRepository,
sideEffectLocalRepository,
referralLocalRepository,
```

‚úÖ **These changes will enable the down sync of registration & delivery data.**



### **‚ú® Registries Update**

When users **downsync data** by passing **project ID & boundary code**, the server returns responses **only for the selected boundary**.



#### **‚úÖ Response Entities:**

-   Structure data is fetched from **MDMS** and displayed as a **card selection UI**.

-   The selected value is stored in the **Additional Details Object** in the **Household Entity**.



### **‚ú® Closed House Data Capture**

-   A **new module** named **closed_household** has been built.

-   This will be a **dependency** of the **registration and delivery package**.



### **‚ú® Handling Unsuccessful Deliveries**

For **household-based flows**, a feature has been introduced to **capture reasons for unsuccessful deliveries**.



### **‚ú® Final Steps**

Once all the above modifications are implemented, rerun:

```
