Health Campaign Management V1.6 - Field Worker's App
====================================================

Overview
--------

The Health Campaign Management (HCM) [latest version](https://github.com/egovernments/health-campaign-field-worker-app/tags) field worker's app is part of the DIGIT Health Platform. It empowers frontline teams to manage health campaigns efficiently, even in low or no network coverage areas. With its offline-first functionality and configurable design, the app is built to address the unique needs of field workers, ensuring seamless data collection, beneficiary management, and campaign tracking.

Key Features
------------

-   **Offline Mode**: Perform all tasks without active internet connectivity.

-   **Four New Modules**: Enable efficient task execution for frontline workers.

-   **Configurable Design**: Adaptable to various campaign needs through server-based configurations.

-   **Multi-Round Campaign Support**: Manage multiple campaign cycles with eligibility checks, delivery tracking, and side-effect recording.

-   **Sync Mechanism**: Bidirectional sync (up and down) ensures consistent data between the app and server.

-   **Beneficiary Data Management**: Optimized retrieval and duplication prevention for beneficiary records.

-   **Permission-Based Access**: Data sync tailored to user roles and assigned projects.

Architecture
------------

The high-level architecture of the app is divided into three core parts:

1.  **Frontend**: Built using Flutter for a multi-platform, user-friendly experience.

2.  **Backend Services**: Syncs with MDMS, localisation, and other backend services.

3.  **Database**: Combines SQLite and ISAR for flexible offline data storage.

Tech Stack/Core Dependencies
----------------------------

-   **Flutter**: Framework to build multi-platform apps.

-   **SQLite**: SQL offline database for structured data.

-   **ISAR**: NoSQL offline database for high-performance storage.

-   **Dio**: HTTP client for network communication.

Design Considerations
---------------------

### General Considerations

-   Works seamlessly in low/no network coverage areas.

-   Highly configurable, with settings managed through MDMS.

-   Designed for Android devices, ensuring compatibility with users who have low-tech literacy.

### Sync Mechanism

-   **Sync Down**: Fetch configurations and data from the server (e.g., localisation, master data).

-   **Sync Up**: Upload collected data to the server.

-   **Login & Sync**: Syncing can only occur while the user is online.

### Configurability

Key configurations include:

-   Offline-first or online-only mode.

-   Backend service URLs and endpoints (no app rebuild required for updates).

-   Data refresh intervals for previously fetched configurations.

-   Supported languages and localisation data.

### Operational Log (Op Log)

All offline actions are logged and processed during sync-up to ensure data consistency and integrity.

### Network Manager

A network manager component abstracts the online/offline logic, enabling seamless data handling by other app components.

Modules and Features
--------------------

### Down Sync of Beneficiaries

Ensures the local device database is updated with the latest beneficiary data while preventing duplicate records.

**Key Features:**

-   Uses offset and limit for efficient pagination.

-   Adapts batch size based on internet speed.

-   Essential for reducing redundancy within the same boundary.

**Use Case:**

-   Particularly useful in multi-user scenarios where teams operate in the same geographical boundary.

### Multi-Round Campaigns

Supports tracking and delivery processes across multiple cycles.

**Key Features:**

-   Fetches configurations dynamically from MDMS.

-   Checks eligibility criteria based on age and project configurations.

-   Tracks delivery status, side effects, and referrals.

-   Resets statuses (e.g., Beneficiary Refused) for each new cycle.

**Delivery Status Tracking:**

-   **Not Eligible**: Fails age or cycle eligibility criteria.

-   **Beneficiary Refused**: User declined the delivery.

-   **Beneficiary Referred**: Referred to a health facility.

-   **Visited**: Delivery successfully completed.

-   **Not Visited**: Delivery not completed.

health-campaign-field-worker-app/tools/attendance_management_imports.dart
```

This will automatically add the necessary:\
‚úÖ Imports\
‚úÖ Mapper initializers\
‚úÖ Route configuration\
‚úÖ Initial data setup\
‚úÖ Repository initialization

* * * * *

### **Step 2: Run Build Runner**

Ensure you are in the correct project directory:

```
apps/health_campaign_field_worker_app
```

Then, run the command:

```
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This will add the necessary package route to the **main router.gr.dart** file.

* * * * *

### **Step 3: Fetch Attendance Registers & Attendee Data**

Navigate to the **Project Bloc**, where attendance data should be fetched after login.

Add the following repositories:

```
final RemoteRepository<AttendanceRegisterModel, AttendanceRegisterSearchModel>
  attendanceRemoteRepository;

final LocalRepository<AttendanceRegisterModel, AttendanceRegisterSearchModel>
  attendanceLocalRepository;

final LocalRepository<AttendanceLogModel, AttendanceLogSearchModel>
  attendanceLogLocalRepository;

final RemoteRepository<AttendanceLogModel, AttendanceLogSearchModel>
  attendanceLogRemoteRepository;
```

* * * * *

### **Step 4: Fetch Attendance Data Based on User Role**

Find the section where **project staff search** is handled.\
Modify the **try-catch block** to fetch attendance data based on role:

```
if (context.loggedInUserRoles
        .where(
          (role) => role.code == RolesType.districtSupervisor.toValue(),
        )
        .toList()
        .isNotEmpty) {
      final individual = await individualRemoteRepository.search(
        IndividualSearchModel(
          userUuid: [projectStaff.userId.toString()],
        ),
      );
      final attendanceRegisters = await attendanceRemoteRepository.search(
        AttendanceRegisterSearchModel(
          staffId: individual.first.id,
          referenceId: projectStaff.projectId,
        ),
      );
      await attendanceLocalRepository.bulkCreate(attendanceRegisters);

      for (final register in attendanceRegisters) {
        if (register.attendees != null &&
            (register.attendees ?? []).isNotEmpty) {
          try {
            final individuals = await individualRemoteRepository.search(
              IndividualSearchModel(
                id: register.attendees!
                    .map((e) => e.individualId!)
                    .toList(),
              ),
            );
            await individualLocalRepository.bulkCreate(individuals);
            final logs = await attendanceLogRemoteRepository.search(
              AttendanceLogSearchModel(
                registerId: register.id,
              ),
            );
            await attendanceLogLocalRepository.bulkCreate(logs);
          } catch (_) {
            emit(state.copyWith(
              loading: false,
              syncError: ProjectSyncErrorType.project,
            ));

            return;
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

* * * * *

### **Step 5: Run Build Runner Again**

Ensure you are still in:

```
apps/health_campaign_field_worker_app
```

Then, run the build runner command again:

```
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This will ensure the package route is properly integrated into **router.gr.dart**.
